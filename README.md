# Minesweeper React Game

Minesweeper is the classic game made popular by its presence on Windows 3.1. I chose it as my first React project because its rules are simple and its UI even simpler. 

The game play is simple. You win by revealing all cells that have no bombs in them. You do that by click on your left button. If you hit a bomb, you lose the game. If you reveal a safe cell, you'll see either a blank cell or a number. A blank cell means there are no bombs around it, whereas a number indicates that there are that many bombs nearby the cell. Use your logical deduction to figure the rest out!
